Currently, the program is made to be run with this command in the command line: 
    python main.py <INPUT FILENAME> > <OUTPUT FILENAME>

The <OUTPUT FILENAME> section could be ommitted if the user wanted to have the output be printed out onto the console.

For example, the included input and output files included would be used like:
    python main.py IO_Files/input.txt > IO_Files/output.txt

However, the user could also go into line 27 of main.py and change the line to a hardcoded input file. Then use the 
command: python main.py to run the program and have the results printed out to the console. One could also run:
python lexer.py > <OUTPUT FILENAME> to output the hardcoded input file to a specific file.
