Currently, the program is made to be run with this command in the command line: 
    python lexer.py <INPUT FILENAME> > <OUTPUT FILENAME>

For example, the included input and output files included would be used like:
    python lexer.py input.txt > output.txt

However, the user could also go into line 72 of lexer.py and change the line to a hardcoded input file. Then use the 
command: python lexer.py to run the program and have the results printed out to the console. One could also run:
python lexer.py > <OUTPUT FILENAME> to output the hardcoded input file to a specific file.
